Implementation of normalized Laplacian decomposition (for spectral clustering purposes etc.) by using a randomized SVD approach.
The involves steps are:
- FPS sampling of the data 
- Kernel matrix low rank approximation (Nystr√∂m approximation)
- Normalize the approximated kernel
- Execution of randomized SVD over the normalized approximated kernel  

Input:
- X: data (np.array)

Output:
- U, S, Vh: the SVD outputs (np.arrays)
